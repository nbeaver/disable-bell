=====================
Disable audible bell.
=====================

This is a script to universally and persistently disable the audible bell
provided by the Linux ``pcspkr`` module,
also known as the
"console beep",
"hardware beep",
"system bell",
"internal speaker",
or "`PC speaker`_".

.. _PC speaker: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_speaker

It copies the `<no-beep.conf>`_ file to ``/etc/modprobe.d/``.

Note that this requires ``sudo`` permissions.
If you do not have them, use this::

    xset b off

to turn it off temporarily,
and add it to your ``~/.profile``
so that it is run every time you log in.

Motivation
----------

    Whenever Iâ€™m poking around in a virtual terminal and I hit ``Tab`` that
    damn beep scares the bejesus out of me.

    One thing that has often annoyed me about most typical Linux installations
    I've seen has been the annoying frequency of console beeps.

    No matter what I try in order to disable the beep, it always comes back.
    Most commonly found when scrolling on emacs or matlab. You can't imagine
    the hatred that I have for this beep.

    It is very annoying to hear loud beeps at home especially at night or when
    listening to music.

    Listening to the PC Speaker beeps via headphones is very close to a feeling
    of hitting your head with a hammer. Even without headphones this beeping
    bell sound is very annoying.
